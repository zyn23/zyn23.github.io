You can't beat video game addiction through willpower alone, you will win the first battles but eventually you will lose. That's why it's so hard to start it in the first place it's like going into a war that you know you're gonna lose.
    How to shape your desire to not even want to play video games anymore:
        1. Doing something productive instead of playing video games doesn't feel good, so when we try to overcome the addiction it feels harder and harder each time we try, inducing our brains to avoid productivity and instead play video games;
        2. Catching creative impulses: When an impulse of creativity appears. Catch it! It trains us to engage in things that are not video games; And since we probably won't do anything with it, we need to reflect on it. Like the next day, asking questions, wtv;
        3. Practicing Gratittude: When we made progress aknowledge that there is negative things about that but appreciate the positive "Atleast I went today." 
        After all this... our desires will start to change, video games are good at causing dopamine to be released in the *nucleus accumbens* and that's why we get addicted. So we need to start cultivating the right kind of desires and we do that by processing the right way our creative impulses, reflecting on them and practicing gratittude.
