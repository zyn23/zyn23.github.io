By some the Feynman technique is viewed as the most effective method to learn and develop a deep understanding.

Who was he? **Richard Feynman** was a Nobel laureate in physics and also a master of demystifying complex topics.

His way of learning consisted of 4 major steps:
1.    Deciding on a topic to focus on/study
2.    Teaching it to a child (As in teaching it to someone but in easy/easier to understand sentences and concepts)
3.    Review and refine your understanding (Write your explanation. The act of writing aids reflection and learning.

4.    Organize and review (Explain it to someone else and if it was clear save it)
